# Coach Scenarios

As you explore your style for coaching, here are some example scenarios to consider.

# Coaching Session

- 1. Starting:
- a. Build rapport ------------------------> "You're a fan of Lord of the Rings too? Love that."
- b. Have them define what they want ------> "How can I help today?"

- 2.  Coaching Tools:
- a. Console log --------------------------> "Ok, let's add a console log on this variable to see how this works."
- b. Add comments -------------------------> "What does this line do? Ok, let's write a comment at the end of that line."
- c. Use zoom annotations to underline ----> "I'm seeing we're missing something here. (coach underlines)"
- d. Use zoom annotations to draw boxes ---> "What is happening in this section? (coach draws box)"
- e. Point out correct code ---------------> "I see you're missing something here, but you have it correct here. (coach underlines)"
- f. Ask for a code walkthrough -----------> "Ok, walk me through how this variable changes. Where does it start?"
- g. Direct message resources -------------> websites (i.e. w3schools or mdn), YouTube tutorial, etc.

- 3. Ending:
- a. Affirm them --------------------------> "I'm proud of you. Good job."
- b. Clarify their needs ------------------> "Is there anything else I can help with today?"
- c. Follow-up ----------------------------> "I hope all is well. Just wanted to follow-up to see if you had any other questions."

# Student Wants Help, but You're Unavailable

- Student: Are you available to help me today?
- Coach: Hi, I’m not available at the moment, but here are some other coaches that may be available...
- Coach: Also, here is the study hall zoom link (https://kenzie.zoom.us/my/studyhall) and schedule...

# Student is Upset with a Kenzie Employee

- Student: Hey, I am really concerned, my facilator is terrible and I don't know who to tell this to.
- Coach: That’s frustrating. I hear you. And I’m thankful you’re sharing feedback to improve the program. I recommend the Kenzie Academy feedback form https://airtable.com/shrUQcRHb9lMbU64Y. The more detail you can provide, the better. I will also share this feedback directly with my supervisor, whose goal is also to make the Kenzie program better. What else would be helpful?
