# The Adventure Begins

On the surface, we're here to help students learn to code, but deeper down we're exploring what it is to be human. To identify problems that exist, take responsibility for at least one of those challenges, and create passion and purpose to discover solutions that makes the world a little bit better place than when we first entered into it. Code is a start to doing exactly that. Growing in our self-awareness, empathy, and communication strategies is how we can do more than that.

In this corner of the universe, enter you. Former vocation: entry-level student. Present vocation: experienced student, coach, and spell-caster. You must know that your words and interactions cast deep, strong magic. You are on a path to further grow the ability for a student facing imposter syndrome, to look at your nonverbal body language, listen to your tone, and hear your ever-developing patience, empathy, and support to find a sense of home at Kenzie Academy, but more importantly with themselves.

You’re on a journey and are taking your next steps.

Welcome to the adventure, my fellow coach. Let’s make the world a better place.
