# 1: The Adventure Begins

It's been said that science fiction and fantasy are two different things: science fiction the improbable made possible; fantasy, the impossible made probable. What would you have if you put these two different things together? Well, you'd have a child grown into an adult, deciding whether or they can be the change they wish to see in the world. Whether or not to brave exploring making their improbable dreams come true.

In this corner of the universe, enter you. Former vocation: entry-level student. Present vocation: experienced student, coach, and spell-caster. You must know that your words and interactions cast deep, strong magic. You have the ability for a student facing imposter syndrome, to look at your nonverbal body language, listen to your tone, and hear your encouraging patience, empathy, and support to find a sense of home at Kenzie Academy, but more importantly with themselves.

On the surface, we're here to help students learn to code, but deeper down we're exploring what it is to be human. To identify problems that exist, take responsibility for at least one of those challenges, and create passion and purpose to discover solutions that makes the world a little bit better place than when we first entered into it. Code is a start to doing exactly that. Growing in our self-awareness, empathy, and communication strategies is how we can do more than that.

You're on a journey and are taking your next steps.

Welcome to the adventure, my fellow coach. Let's make dreams come true.
