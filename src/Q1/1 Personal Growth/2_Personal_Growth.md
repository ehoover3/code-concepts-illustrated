# 1. Vulnerability

Watch this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4kMA4fSV_k
If a student is struggling to learn code, some students "armor up" from asking for coaching help.
Build relationships and trust with students, to decrease their fear of judgment, fear, blame, and ridicule.
Be open to being vulnerable and communicate with empathy.

# 2. Empathy

Watch this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw
Empathy builds connection with students. Empathy's 4 qualities are:
-1. Recognize another person's perspective as their truth
-2. Stay out of judgment
-3. Recognize emotion in another person
-4. Communicate that emotion that person

Empathy is a vulnerable choice of feeling with another person.
In order to connect with you, I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling.

Sympathy Examples
-Denial --------------> There is nothing wrong. Everything is fine.
-Diagnose ------------> You are too sensitive.
-Downplaying ---------> It's not that bad! It's not the end of the world.
-Expectation ---------> You should have known better. Get over it. Don't let it get to you.
-Positive Spin -------> Look on the bright side. This happened for a reason.
-Put Down ------------> Don't be ridiculous.
-Reasoning -----------> Can't you see the other person didn't mean to hurt you?
-Steal the Spotlight -> Now you know how I felt when the same thing happened to me.

Empathy Examples
-Acknowledge Them ----> I'm sorry to hear about that.
-Acknowledge Them ----> Thank you for sharing this with me.
-Acknowledge Them ----> Thank you for understanding.
-Acknowledge Them ----> That must be really frustrating.
-Acknowledge Them ----> You're not alone. I've felt that way too.
-Clarify -------------> Anything else I can help with today?
-Clarify -------------> Are you asking me to problem solve or just listen?
-Clarify -------------> How can I help?
-Clarify -------------> How should we move forward?
-Clarify -------------> I'm hearing you say... Is that correct?
-Clarify -------------> What are our options?
-Clarify -------------> What do you need from me?

# 3. Four Horsemen

Watch this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHAiAJybCSU
Examples ------> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQOgAgfDm_8
A coach's goal is to build positive relationships. The Four Horsemen are communication styles that worsen relationships.

Here are the toxic Four Horsemen and their healthy cures:
-1. Criticism ("You're doing this wrong") --------------------> Use a Gentle Startup ("I noticed this")
-2. Defensive ("We just need better students") ---------------> Take Responsibility ("How can I be a better coach?")
-3. Contempt (coach eyerolling or deep sighing at student) ---> Share Appreciation ("I like how you did this.")
-4. Stonewall (Student asks for help, coach never responds) --> If unavailable, redirect ("Thanks for reaching out. I'm not available today, but these coaches might be")

# 4. Active Listening

Watch this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaEw7ZFs5sU
When students feel heard and understood, they are more engaged with learning with the coach.
-Active Listening: Focusing on what they are saying and confirming your understanding of what they said
-Mirroring: Confirm understanding by rephrasing what they said.
-Tactical Empathy: "I'm hearing you say..." "It seems like you're..."
-Calibrated Questions: Instead of saying no, help them explore their thoughts. "How am I supposed to do that?"

# 5. Set Healthy Boundaries

Watch this video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9PFlSPIJA8
As a coach, your job isn't to say yes to every student all the time.
Prioritize your self-care, your studies, then coaching.
If you're not available to meet with a student, redirect them to other coaches, study hall, or other.
