# 2: Personal Growth

(CURRENT WORK IN PROGRESS)

Personal growth is 3 steps: Self-Awareness, Inner Thoughts and Feelings, and Relationships

Consider this...

IN THE NEGATIVE
If my self-view isn't right,
my thoughts will not be right,
which skews how way I relate to others,
which limits results

IN THE POSITIVE
If I know who I am,
my thought process will be open-minded,
which creates space in building relationships,
which drives collaborative results

If we want to improve our coaching results, we start by braving the vulnerability of improving ourself. Let's do exactly that.

# Growth in Self-Awareness Starts with Vulnerability and Empathy

1. Start by watching these videos:

- 1. VULNERABILITY - www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4kMA4fSV_k
- Scaricity culture is summed up as never enough:
- never good enough, never certain enough, never perfect enough, never extraordinary enough.
- In response to scarcity culture, we armor up to protect ourself from judgment, fear, blame, and ridicule
- However, armoring up doesn't really safeguard from pain.
- If we take our armor down and lean into vulnerability, vulnerability is the path that leads to love, belonging, joy, intimacy, trust, innovation, creativity, and empathy.

- 2. EMPATHY - www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw
- Empathy fuels connection
- Sympathy drives disconnection

- The four qualities of empathy are:
- a. perspective taking and the ability to recognize another person's perspective as their truth
- b. staying out of judgment
- c. recognizing emotion in other people
- d. communicating that emotion to other people

- Sympathy is being disconnected from our and their feelings.
- Sympathy often emerges when, with good intentions, we try to fix things or make things better without first understanding the feelings and needs of the person we're trying to support.

- Scenario: Student says "I can't debug this."
- Sympathy response A: Coach says "You need to do this."
- Sympathy response B: Coach says "At least, you got this part right."

- On the surface, the student is trying to debug a coding problem, but deeper down, there is a subconscious question of "Do I still belong in the Kenzie program? Do people see me and understand me? Am I alone?"
- A sympathy, while in good intentions, can result in the student feeling further disconnected and less motivated.

- Empathy is feeling with other people and is a choice of vulnerability.
- In order to connect with you, I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling.
- Empathy Example: "I know what that is like and you're not alone."

- Scenario: Student says "I can't debug this."
- Empathy response A: "I've had this same problem before too. I'm with you. What should our next step be?"
- Empathy response B: "That's frustrating, I hear you. May I make suggestion?"

- Sometimes people on the surface say they want something. As a coach, we have to be considering their subtext.
- The subtext is what are they feeling or truly needing in the moment?
- As a coach, how can you respond in a way that answers their subtext questions first, then their coding question?

# Inner Thoughts and Feelings

Let's go there. Let's lean into vulnerability.

3. Here's the deal, if we are disconnected from our own inner state, then we are limited in our ability to have empathy with students.

- 1. You're stressed out all the time
- 2. You've lost sight of yourself
- 3. You've been through something traumatic
- 4. You're recovering from abuse
- 5. You're grieving an important loss
- 6. You're struggling with mental illness
- 7. You're on too much medication
