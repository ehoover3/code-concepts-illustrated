If a student is struggling to learn code, some students "armor up" from asking for coaching help.
Build relationships and trust with students, to decrease their fear of judgment, fear, blame, and ridicule.
Be open to being vulnerable and communicate with empathy.

# 2. Empathy

Empathy builds connection with students. Empathy's 4 qualities are:
-1. Recognize another person's perspective as their truth
-2. Stay out of judgment
-3. Recognize emotion in another person
-4. Communicate that emotion that person

Empathy is a vulnerable choice of feeling with another person.
In order to connect with you, I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling.
-Example: "I know what that is like and you're not alone."

# 3. Active Listening

When students feel heard and understood, they are more engaged with learning with the coach.
-Active Listening: Focusing on what they are saying and confirming your understanding of what they said
-Mirroring: Confirm understanding by rephrasing what they said.
-Tactical Empathy: "I'm hearing you say..." "It seems like you're..."
-Calibrated Questions: Instead of saying no, help them explore their thoughts. "How am I supposed to do that?"

# 4. Set Healthy Boundaries

As a coach, your job isn't to say yes to every student all the time.
Prioritize your self-care, your studies, then coaching.
If you're not available to meet with a student, redirect them to other coaches, study hall, or other.

# 5. Name It to Tame It
