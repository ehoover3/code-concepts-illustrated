# 3: Scenarios

# Coach Session

- 1. Start of the Session - Build the relationship right away
     "Oh! Awesome star wars shirt!"
     (If LOTR desktop background) "You're a fan of Lord of the Rings too? Love that."

- 2. Let them define the challenge
     "How can I help today?"
     "What do the instructions say about this?"

- 3. As you discover what works for your coaching style, here are some methods to consider.

     ADD COMMENTS
     Sometimes it helps to have them comment and describe every line.
     "What does this line do? Ok, let's write a comment at the end of that line."

     USE ZOOM ANNOTATIONS TO UNDERLINE/DRAW BOXES
     "What is happening inside of this section here? (coach underlines/draws box)"
     "I'm seeing we're missing something here (coach underlines/draws box)."

     HIGHLIGHT WHAT THEY HAVE RIGHT
     When a student is stuck, point out another area in the code, where they have it right.
     "I'm seeing you're missing something here, that you did correctly over here. (coach underlines/draws box)"

     CONSOLE LOG
     "Ok, let's add a console log on this variable to see how this works."

     ASK FOR A CODE WALKTHROUGH
     Some student don't know how data flows, i.e. how variables change, when certain functions run, etc.
     "Ok, walk me through how this variable changes when the program runs. Where does it start?"

- 4. Ending the Session - Affirm and Explore More or Redirect
     "I'm proud of you."
     "Is there anything else I can help with today?"
     "Ok, I have other students to reach out to, but let me send you a quick youtube resource."
     "It seems like you're off to a good direction. Let's reconnect if you run into more challenges."

- 5. Follow-Up
     Consider sending a slack message with a relevant image, youtube video, or website.
