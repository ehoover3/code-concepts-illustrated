# English as a Second Language Students

Some English as a second language students present unique communication challenges between the student and the coach.

While we recognize admissions role in setting English standards and screening students for English comprehension, the truth is these students are here now like the rest of us and are trying to make a better life and future for themselves. While it may be harder to coach these individuals, I admire your perserverance and determination to support all student from all backgrounds. As you form your own best practices, here are some best practices past coaches have discovered.

# Best Practices Ideas

- Communicate with more than words

1. Share a list that matches the symbols with the vocab word
2. Use zoom annotations to underline words while you read instructions out loud
3. Use Google Translate

- Encourage their English learning

1. Set phone and computer settings to English
2. Watch movies, TV, etc. in English with subtitles on
3. Practice daily with resources like Duolingo
4. If you're bilingual in their language, encourage them to practice English with you

Thank you for reading and considering these thoughts.
