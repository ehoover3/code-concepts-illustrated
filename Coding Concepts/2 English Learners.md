# English as a 2nd Language Students

Some English as a second language students present unique communication challenges between the student and the coach.

While we recognize admissions role in setting English standards and screening students for English comprehension, the truth is these students are here now like the rest of us and are trying to make a better life and future for themselves. While it may be harder to coach these individuals, I admire your perserverance and determination to support all student from all backgrounds. As you form your own best practices, here are some best practices past coaches have discovered.

# Best Practices
