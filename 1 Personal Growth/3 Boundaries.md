# Boundaries

# 1. Great Coaches DON'T get involved in the Drama Triangle

The Drama Triangle is:
-Victim -----------------> Student: "I can't do this assignment" ----> Avoids Responsibility / Feels Powerless
-Villain / Persecutor ---> Student: "My facilitator is terrible." ---> Blames
-Hero / Rescuer ---------> Coach: "Let me do it for you" ------------> Temporary relief, but doesn't solve root issue

The Empowerment Dynamic is:
-Creator ----------------> Student: "I can do this" -----------------> Takes responsibilty
-Challenge --------------> Coach: "You can do this" -----------------> Encourages
-Coach ------------------> Coach: "How will you solve this?" --------> Asks questions, makes observations

Your role isn't to do everything for students.
If you're feeling burned out, that is a sign your boundaries might be too porous.
Self-care is important care, and self-care isn't selfish.

Here are 7 ways to set healthier boundaries:
1 Set Personal Boundaries
2 Communicate Upfront
3 Create Clear Structure
4 Keep Relationships Professional
5 Delegate Work When Appropriate
6 Be Able to Say No
7 Take Time Off to Recharge
