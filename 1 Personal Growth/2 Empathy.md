-Some students "armor up" from asking for help
-"Armoring up" comes from student's fear of judgment, failure, blame, or ridicule
-Coaches can decrease this fear by being appropriately vulnerable and using empathy

# 2. Great Coaches Communicate with Empathy

-Empathy builds connection with students.
-Empathy's 4 qualities are:
-1. Recognize another person's perspective as their truth
-2. Stay out of judgment
-3. Recognize emotion in another person
-4. Communicate that emotion that person

Empathy is a vulnerable choice of feeling with another person.
In order to connect with you, I have to connect with something in myself that knows that feeling.

Sympathy may communicate logical understanding, but is disconnected from the other person's or our own feelings.

Sympathy Examples
-Denial --------------> There is nothing wrong. Everything is fine.
-Diagnose ------------> You are too sensitive.
-Downplaying ---------> It's not that bad! It's not the end of the world.
-Expectation ---------> You should have known better. Get over it. Don't let it get to you.
-Positive Spin -------> Look on the bright side. This happened for a reason.
-Put Down ------------> Don't be ridiculous.
-Reasoning -----------> Can't you see the other person didn't mean to hurt you?
-Steal the Spotlight -> Now you know how I felt when the same thing happened to me.

Empathy Examples
-Acknowledge Them ----> I'm sorry to hear about that.
-Acknowledge Them ----> Thank you for sharing this with me.
-Acknowledge Them ----> Thank you for understanding.
-Acknowledge Them ----> That must be really frustrating.
-Acknowledge Them ----> You're not alone. I've felt that way too.
-Clarify -------------> Anything else I can help with today?
-Clarify -------------> Are you asking me to problem solve or just listen?
-Clarify -------------> How can I help?
-Clarify -------------> How should we move forward?
-Clarify -------------> I'm hearing you say... Is that correct?
-Clarify -------------> What are our options?
-Clarify -------------> What do you need from me?

Great coaches build positive relationships with students.
The Four Horsemen are communication styles that worsen relationships.

Here are the toxic Four Horsemen and their healthy cures:
-1. Criticism ("You're doing this wrong") --------------------> Use a Gentle Startup ("I noticed this")
-2. Defensive ("We just need better students") ---------------> Take Responsibility ("How can I be a better coach?")
-3. Contempt (coach eyerolling or deep sighing at student) ---> Share Appreciation ("I like how you did this.")
-4. Stonewall (Student asks for help, coach never responds) --> If unavailable, redirect ("Thanks for reaching out. I'm not available today, but these coaches might be")
